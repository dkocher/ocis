Feature: Space management
  As a user with space admin permission
  I want to be able to manage all existing project space
  - I can get all project space where I am not member using "graph/v1.0/drives" endpoint
  - I can edit space: change quota, name, description
  - I can enable, disable, delete space

  Note - this feature is run in CI with ACCOUNTS_HASH_DIFFICULTY set to the default for production
  See https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1542 and https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/839

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |

    When user "Brian" lists all spaces via the GraphApi with query "$filter=driveType eq 'project'"
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the json responded should contain a space "Project" with these key and value pairs:
      | key       | value      |
      | driveType | project    |
      | id        | %space_id% |
